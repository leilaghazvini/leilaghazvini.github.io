### Abstract

This study aims to examine the relationship between air and water quality in various cities across Los Angeles County and their corresponding average income levels, focusing on identifying potential disparities in access to clean air and water among lower-income communities. It is hypothesized that areas with lower income levels experience limited access to clean air and water resources. Data were collected from public sources including the California Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessment and the 2022 census. Air and water quality data were ranked on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 representing the lowest and 3 the highest quality. The data were then analyzed using ArcGIS software. The collected data were visualized through five figures: (1) Air and water quality population percentage by ranking, (2) Air quality represented in PM2.5 levels, (3) Drinking water quality ranked on a scale of 1 to 3, (4) Drinking water quality in relation to distance from the LA river, and (5) Median income per city. A negative correlation was observed between air quality and median income levels, indicating poorer air quality in lower-income areas. However, no significant correlation was found between water quality and median income.The study highlights the adverse impact of poor air quality on low-income communities and underscores the importance of addressing this issue as a public health concern.
