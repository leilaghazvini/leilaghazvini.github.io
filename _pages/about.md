Hi, my name is Leila Ghazvini and I received a bachelors in Environmental Studies with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems from the University of California Santa Cruz in 2023. Following my studies I took a gap year which I spent traveling and working as a tutor. Growing up in Redondo Beach, I have grown a deep appreciation for nature. As a result, I aim to expand peopleâ€™s access to green areas throughout LA county. My background in GIS has allowed me to learn the necessary skills for researching prevalent issues within our communities. One of the issues that I am specifically interested in is comparing air quality throughout the county and making sure that all communities regardless of economic background can have access to fresh air by reducing pollution. I have a deep connection with LA County and aspires to be an environmental planner in the area where I aim to develop solutions for these problems. In my spare time I love to run on the beach and go on picnics with my friends.
