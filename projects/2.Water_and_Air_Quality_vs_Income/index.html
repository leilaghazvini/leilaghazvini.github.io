It is hypothesized that areas with lower income levels experience limited access to clean air and water resources. Data was collected from public sources including the California Office of Environmental Health Hazards Assessment and the 2022 census. Air and water quality data was ranked on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 representing the lowest and 3 the highest quality. The data was then analyzed using ArcGIS software. The collected data was visualized through five figures: (1) Air and water quality population percentage by ranking, (2) Air quality represented in PM2.5 levels, (3) Drinking water quality ranked on a scale of 1 to 3, (4) Drinking water quality in relation to distance from the LA river, and (5) Median income per city. A negative correlation was observed between air quality and median income levels, indicating poorer air quality in lower-income areas. However, no significant correlation was found between water quality and median income.The study highlights the adverse impact of poor air quality on low-income communities and underscores the importance of addressing this issue as a public health concern.</p> <hr> <h3 id="tables-and-figures">Tables and Figures</h3> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/fig1_bothnew-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/fig1_bothnew-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/fig1_bothnew-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fig1_bothnew.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Figure 1 Air quality represented in PM2.5" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/fig2_bothnew-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/fig2_bothnew-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/fig2_bothnew-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fig2_bothnew.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Figure 2 Drinking Water quality ranked from a scale of 1-3" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><strong>Figure 1</strong> Air Quality Represented in PM2.5 (left) <strong>Figure 2</strong> Drinking Water Quality Ranked from a Scale of 1-3 (right)</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/fig3_bothnew-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/fig3_bothnew-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/fig3_bothnew-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fig3_bothnew.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Figure 3 Drink water quality ranked 1-3 and Los Angeles River" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/fig4_bothnew-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/fig4_bothnew-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/fig4_bothnew-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fig4_bothnew.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Figure 4 Median income per city split into 3 categories" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><strong>Figure 3</strong> Drinking water quality ranked 1-3 and Los Angeles River (left) <strong>Figure 4</strong> Median income per city split into 3 categories (right)</p> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/table-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/table-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/table-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/table.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Table 1 Air and water quality population percentage by ranking" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p><strong>Table 1</strong> Air and Water Quality Population Percentage by Ranking</p> </body></html>
